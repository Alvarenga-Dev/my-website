    "title": "About Me",
    "content": "If you already know me, you know my name is Lucas Alvarenga, but many people also call me Alvarenga! I am a self-taught Android developer with 5 years of experience creating high-quality applications. I have strong skills in designing, developing, and testing Android apps, along with solid knowledge of programming languages, libraries, and essential frameworks for the ecosystem. I enjoy solving problems, working in a team, and self-managing to deliver efficient Android development solutions.<br /><br /> I started programming at the age of 13, specifically with Android, using Java back in 2017. As I was about to enter high school, I wanted to study at a technical school. The following year, I enrolled at Rezende Rammel to take an IT course. It was three incredible years where I deepened my knowledge, especially in Java and later in Kotlin. Additionally, I had contact with other languages such as JavaScript, PHP, C, and Pascal, as well as frameworks like React.js and Flutter.<br /><br /> In 2020, I finally decided that I wanted to pursue a career as an Android developer. I went through several selection processes and interviews until I landed my first internship, and within just three months, I was hired. At the same time, since August 2019, I have been creating technology content, documenting my journey from student to software developer.<br />"
